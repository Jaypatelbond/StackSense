// Since kotlinOptions inside android block is deprecated/erroring for jvmTarget,
// we should configure it via the top-level kotlin extension usually, 
// OR the error specifically said: "Using 'jvmTarget: String' is an error."
// It means we can't assign string "17". We might be able to assign JvmTarget.JVM_17 if we cast or imported it?
// However, standard fix is to use compilerOptions.
// Let's add the kotlin block at the end of the file or use configuration.

// Actually, wait. The replace above just removed jvmTarget line and added freeCompilerArgs?
// I need to set jvmTarget!
// If I remove it, it might default to 1.8. 
// I should properly set it.

// Let's use the kotlin extension block outside android block, or compilerOptions inside if supported.
// Given strict kts, let's try appending the kotlin block.
